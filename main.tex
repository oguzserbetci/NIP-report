\begin{abstract}
\textit{Utility functions are often used to explain human risk behaviour under uncertainty. We present a class of reinforcement learning agents trained on different utility functions that are able to mimic risky choice under uncertainty. We use self-gathered experimental data capturing risk profiles of human participants and apply the agent's results to them. From that, we deduct that the widely used exponential utility function might not be able to explain all human risk profiles. In turn, we present two other utility functions that could be suited for mapping risk profiles.}

\section{Objectives}\label{sec:objectives}
The objective of this research is threefold:
\begin{itemize}
    \item First we want to conduct an experiment to observe peoples behaviour when facing risky choice. 
    \item Second we want to explicitly reassess whether human behaviour is consistently described by the exponential utility function.
    \item Third and finally we want to present an approach to derive utility a persons utility functions based on their observed behaviour
\end{itemize}

\section{Behavioral data for all subjects}
All of the behavioral data fitted with linear kernel support vector machine is shown in~\autoref{fig:all_beh}.
