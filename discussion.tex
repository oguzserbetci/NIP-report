Using the experimental data and reinforcement learning agents, we could provide evidence that the exponential utility function is not able to capture all human risk behaviour under uncertainty. While the EUF implies a time-independent policy, we found that the majority of our participants acted in a time-dependent manner. The parametrized $\text{sinh}$ utility function seems to explain these participants fairly well.

However, much work is left to be done. In particular, solving the inverse reinforcement learning problem to obtain utility function corresponding to risk-profiles in a more direct and accurate way.
